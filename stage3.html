Stage 3: Prep (The Spice & Garnish)
• The Logic: Precise Tap/Placement.
• The Gameplay: A bowl of Bessara is on the screen. Small icons of olive oil, cumin, and paprika float by.
• Maximum Reality Touch: You have to tap them at the perfect time to "land" them in the bowl. Land a perfect drop of olive oil, and Azul pops up with a "Molecular Perfection" rating.
